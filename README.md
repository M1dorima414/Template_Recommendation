# Template_Recommendation

You can use Streamlit_final_fine_tuned.py to run the streamlit application and we only need fine_tuned_case_matched.parquet and fine_tuned_template_matched.parquet two tables. xgb_finetune.joblib is the final model we used. You also need to use download the Fine_Tuned_Transformer_1_10 folder to run the code.
